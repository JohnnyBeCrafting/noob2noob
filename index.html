 <p>Don't judge this site by its "cover". We're going to learn the ins-and-outs of HTML and CSS by starting with this bare-bones structure, and coding our way to this...</p>
 <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="/assets/images/noob2noob.png" height=500px width=500px/>
 </div>
 <p>And that's only the beginning. This site will be constantly evolving as a reflection of our skills. As we progress in our abilities, so shall this site exhibit new features and robust design layouts. Stick around for the ride- it'll be worth it.</p>
