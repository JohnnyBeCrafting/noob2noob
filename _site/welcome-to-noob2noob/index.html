    <h1 id="why-noob2noob">Why Noob2Noob</h1>

<p>I’ve been there. Trying to overcome a massive learning curve on your own is difficult, though rewarding in the end. As I’ve been pursuing my individual mastery of HTML/CSS and all of web-design, I’ve come across helpful tutorials as well as some that weren’t as helpful. What makes a great tutorial? I’ll go through some qualifications and share why I’ve decided to build Noob2Noob.</p>

<h3 id="empathy-for-the-learner">Empathy for the learner</h3>

<p>I hear this word thrown a lot often in web-design circles, though I believe it should also be used in education. Empathy is the ability to “put yourself in someone else’s shoes” and experience the emotions of another person. Whether it’s joy, sadness, doubt, or fear- an empathetic person can think beyond his/herself and truly understand what someone else is going through.</p>

<p>A great tutorial understands the pains of those trying to learn a new language and goes above and beyond to guide that person into proficiency (and eventual mastery). </p>

<p>Some of the most frustrating tutorials are those that offer mediocre explanations for the sake of brevity or make sweeping assumptions of what you know at that point. The worst make no effort in breaking down jargon and explaining <strong><em>why</em></strong> things work the way they do. </p>

<p>As a noob, I’m aware that getting to a complete understanding of something requires that I know why and how things happen. </p>

<h3 id="storytelling">Storytelling</h3>

<p>A great tutorial makes for a great story, with plenty of illustrations of the concepts being introduced. I particularly love the ones that initially show the final website/project and set the roadmap for where we’re heading. </p>

<p>Here’s an example of a nice <a href="http://callmenick.com/2014/09/08/advanced-parallax-scrolling-effect/">tutorial</a> form the folks at callmenick- they specialize in front end web development: </p>

<h4 id="the-good">The Good</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There’s a link to the demo which shows the final outcome (i.e. site, app, etc.) This puts everything into perspective: by knowing what I’ll be building beforehand, I’ll have a better understanding of why I’m typing in these strange markup tags and styling this or that. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember- a great tutorial makes for a cool story. In the case of a front-end dev story, the characters are usually HTML/CSS markup tags and JS scripts. Before diving deep into the step-by-step guide, I’d like to get to know the important building blocks first. For example, if the site I’m building includes stacks of images layered on top of each other, it’s important to introduce the &lt;li&gt; element. What’s so special about the &lt;li&gt; element? What are its quirks, how does it fit in the larger scheme we’re building?<img src="http://localhost:8000/assets/images/images-blog-one/screenshot-two-demo.png" width="600" height="600" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Focus on the why- Don’t just tell me where to stick some random html tag. Get to the heart of the concept. The fine line that separates good tutorials from great ones is demarcated by how well it encourages me to think about what I’m creating. 
Why is understanding important? Because it separates copy-and-paste-hackers from genuine developers. While I won’t claim to be the latter, real programmers know how to debug (a <em>crucial</em> skill to have). Debugging requies a thorough understanding of the problem and an appreciation for the quirks of markup languages. CSS, for example, gets weird real quick.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="code-experimentation">Code Experimentation</h3>
<p>I love sites like <a href="http://www.jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle</a> and <a href="http://www.codepen.com">codepen</a>. They’re lightweight solutions for whipping up some code and following along with any guide. For example, if I’m reading up on how to create forms, a codepen embed would enable me to play around with the code and “learn by doing.” </p>

<p>Here’s an example of a codepen embed- you can look at the final output I’ve built (i.e. the form)- and investigate the HTML and CSS components. You can also modify the existing code under the “HTML” and “CSS” tabs and click on “Result” to see any changes. </p>

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="11760" data-slug-hash="MYmaaz" data-default-tab="result" data-user="johnnyginbound" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/johnnyginbound/pen/MYmaaz/">Contact Form</a> by Johnny Garces (<a href="http://codepen.io/johnnyginbound">@johnnyginbound</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

<h1 id="we-got-this">We got this</h1>

<p>I understand the pains of overcoming learning obstacles. Even in web-development, the bar has been set high with new frameworks being deployed everywhere. It seems teams are creating unique development environments that are tough to assimilate in. They require knowledge such as SASS, HAML, Grunt.js, etc., and the process of learning looks more like an optical illusion (going nowhere fast). </p>

<p>Despite the current trends, I’m a firm believer in first establishing a solid foundation in  HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Creating projects is the optimal way to learn and I hope to provide that opportunity on Noob2Noob. While I continue to embark on my personal web-development adventure, I’m excited to take you along for the ride and share my knowledge so that together, we can conquer our own hurdles.</p>
